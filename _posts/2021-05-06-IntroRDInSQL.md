# 1. Introduction to relational databases

## 1.1. First Example
**A relational database:**
* Real-life entities become tables.
* Reduced redundancy 
* Data integrity by relationships

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables;
```
<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic1.png" class="largepic"/>

```sql
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'pg_config';
```
<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic2.png" class="largepic"/>

`information_schema` is a meta-database that holds information about your current database. `information_schema` has multiple tables you can query with the known **SELECT * FROM** syntax:
* `tables`: information about all tables in your current database
* `columns`: information about all columns in all of the tables in your current database


**Count Column**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM information_schema.columns
 WHERE table_catalog = 'database_name' -- the database
   AND table_name = 'table_name'
```

How many columns does the table `university_professors` have?


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM information_schema.columns
 WHERE table_schema = 'public' -- the database
   AND table_name = 'university_professors'
```

## 1.2. Tables

**One "entity type" in the database**

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic3.png" class="largepic"/>

**Better database with four entity types**

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic4.png" class="largepic"/>

**Create new tables with CREATE TABLE**

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather ( 
    clouds text, 
    temperature numeric, 
    weather_station char(5)
);
```

**ADD a COLUMN with ALTER TABLE**

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;

-- Add the university_shortname column
Alter table professors
Add column university_shortname text;

```

## 1.3. Update your database as the structure changes

**Current database model**

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic5.png" class="largepic"/>

**Only store DISTINCT data in new tables**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM university_professors;

1377

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT organization) 
FROM university_professors;

1287
```

**INSERT DISTINCT records INTO the new tables**

```sql
--The INSERT INTO statement manually

INSERT INTO table_name (column_a, column_b) 
VALUES ("value_a", "value_b");

INSERT INTO organizations 
SELECT DISTINCT organization,
    organization_sector 
FROM university_professors;
```

**RENAME a COLUMN in affiliations**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;
```

**A professor is uniquely identified by firstname,lastname only**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname, university_shortname
FROM university_professors 
ORDER BY lastname;

SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname
FROM university_professors
ORDER BY lastname;

same (551 records)
```
<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic6.png" class="largepic"/>

So the `university_shortname` column is not needed in order to reference a professor in the affiliations table. You can remove it, and this will reduce the redundancy in your database again


**DROP a COLUMN in affiliations**
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name 
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

**Delete tables with DROP TABLE**
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
# 2. Enforce data consistency with attribute constraints

Specify data types in columns, enforce column uniqueness, and disallow NULL values in this chapter.

## 2.1. Better data quality with constraints

**Intergrity constraints**
1. Attribute constraints, e.g. data types on columns 
2. Key constraints, e.g. primary keys 
3. Referential integrity constraints, enforced through foreign keys 

**Why constraints?**
* Constraints give the data structure (With good constraints in plce, people who type in birthdates, for example, have to enter them in always the same form)
* Constraints help with consistency, and thus data quality (meaning that a row in a certain table has exactly the same form as the next row, and so forth)
* Data quality is a business advantage / data science prerequisite 
* Enforcing is difficult, but PostgreSQL helps

**PostgreSQL data types as attribute constraints**

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic7.png" class="largepic"/>

**Dealing with data types (casting)**
```sql
SELECT temperature * CAST(wind_speed AS integer) AS wind_chill 
FROM weather;
```

## 2.2 Working with data types

**Working with data types**
* Enforced on columns (i.e. attributes) 
* Define the so-called "domain" of a column (what form these values can take â€“ and what not)
* Define what operations are possible (a street number will always be an actual number, and a postal code will always have no more than 6 digits)
* Enfore consistent storage of values

**The most common types**
* `text`: character strings of any length
* `varchar[(x)]`: a maximum of `n`characters
* `char[(x)]`: a fixed-length string of `n` characters
* `boolean`: can only take three states, e.g. `TRUE`,`FALSE` and `NULL`
* `date`,`time` and `timestamp`: various formats for date and time calculations
* `numeric` : arbitrary precision numbers, e.g. `3.1457`
* `integer`: whole numbers in the range of `-2147483648` and `++2147483647`

**CHAR vs VARCHAR**
* CHAR
    1. Used to store character string value of fixed length.
    2 .The maximum no. of characters the data type can hold is 255 characters.
    3. It's 50% faster than VARCHAR.
    4. Uses static memory allocation.
* VARCHAR
    1. Used to store variable length alphanumeric data.
    2. The maximum this data type can hold is up to
    3. Pre-MySQL 5.0.3: 255 characters.
    4. Post-MySQL 5.0.3: 65,535 characters shared for the row.
    5. It's slower than CHAR.
    6. Uses dynamic memory allocation.

```sql
Create table temp
(City CHAR(10),
Street VARCHAR(10));

Insert into temp
values('Pune','Oxford');

select length(city), length(street) from temp;
Output will be

length(City)          Length(street)
10                    6
```
**Specifying types upon table creation**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students ( 
    ssn integer,
    name varchar(64), 
    dob date,
    average_grade numeric(3, 2), -- e.g. 5.54 
    tuition_paid boolean
);
```

**Alter types after table creation**
```sql
ALTER TABLE students 
ALTER COLUMN name
TYPE varchar(128);

ALTER TABLE students
ALTER COLUMN average_grade 
TYPE integer
-- Turns 5.54 into 6, not 5, before type conversion 
USING ROUND(average_grade);
```

```sql
-- Change the type of firstname
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN firstname
TYPE varchar(64);

-- Convert the values in firstname to a max. of 16 characters
ALTER TABLE professors 
ALTER COLUMN firstname 
TYPE varchar(16)
USING SUBSTRING(firstname  FROM 1 FOR 16)
```

## 2.3. The not-null and unique constraints

**The not-null constraint**
* Disallow `NULL` values in a certain column
* Must hold true for the current state 
* Must hold true for any future state

**What does NULL mean?**
* unknown
* does not exist
* does not apply

**Add or remove a not-null constraint**
```sql
CREATE TABLE students ( 
    ssn integer not null,
    lastname varchar(64) not null, 
    home_phone integer, 
    office_phone integer
);

ALTER TABLE students 
ALTER COLUMN home_phone 
SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE students 
ALTER COLUMN ssn 
DROP NOT NULL;
```

**The Unique constraints**
* Disallow duplicate values in a column 
* Must hold true for the current state 
* Must hold true for any future state

**Adding unique constraints**
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name ( 
    column_name UNIQUE
);

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT some_name UNIQUE(column_name);
```

# 3. Uniquely identify records with key constraints

Add primary and foreign keys to the tables. 

## 3.1. Keys and superkeys

**The database model with primary keys**

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic8.png" class="largepic"/>

**What is a key?**
* Attribute(s) that identify a record uniquely
* As long as attributes can be removed: superkey
* If no more attributes can be removed: minimal superkey or key

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic9.png" class="largepic"/>
* SK1 = {license_no, serial_no, make, model, year} 
* SK2 = {license_no, serial_no, make, model}
* SK3 = {make, model, year}, SK4 = {license_no, serial_no}, SKi, ..., SKn

The combination of all attributes is a superkey. If we remove the "year" attribute from the superkey, the six records are still unique, so it's still a superkey.

However, there are only four minimal superkeys:
K1 =  = {license_no}; K2 = {serial_no}; K3 = {model}; K4 = {make, year}
* K1 to 3 only consist of one attribute
* Removing either "make" or "year" from K4 would result in duplicates 
* Only one candidate key can be the chosen key

These four minimal superkeys are also called **candidate keys**. Why candidate keys? In the end, there can only be one key for the table, which has to be chosen from the candidates

**Practice**
1. Count the distinct records for all possible combinations of columns. If the resulting number x equals the number of all rows in the table for a combination, you have discovered a superkey.
2. Then remove one column after another until you can no longer remove columns without seeing the number x decrease. If that is the case, you have discovered a (candidate) key.

```sql
-- Try out different combinations
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(firstname,lastname)) 
FROM professors;
```

## 3.2. Primary keys

**Primary keys**
* One primary key per database table, chosen from candidate keys 
* Uniquely identifies records, e.g. for referencing in other tables 
* Unique and not-null constraints both apply
* Primary keys are time-invariant: choose columns wisely!

**Specifying primary keys**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
    name text,
    price numeric
    );

--Specify primary keys
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY, 
    name text,
    price numeric
    );
CREATE TABLE example ( 
    a integer,
    b integer, 
    c integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (a, c)
);

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT some_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name)
```


**Practice**
```sql
-- Rename the organization column to id
ALTER TABLE organizations
RENAME COLUMN organization TO id;

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT organization_pk PRIMARY KEY (id);
```

## 3.3. Surrogate keys

**Surrogate keys**
* Primary keys should be built from as few columns as possible 
* Primary keys should never change over time

**Adding a surrogate key with serial data type**
```sql
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN id serial PRIMARY KEY; 
INSERT INTO cars
VALUES ('Volkswagen','Blitz','black');
```

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic10.png" class="largepic"/>

If you try to specify an ID that already exists, the primary key constraint will prevent you from doing so. So, after all, the "id" column uniquely identifies each record in this table â€“ which is very useful, for example, when you want to refer to these records from another table

```sql
INSERT INTO cars
VALUES ('Opel', 'Astra', 'green', 1);
```

<img src="/assets/images/20210506_IntroRDInSQL/pic11.png" class="largepic"/>

**Another type of surrogate key**

Another strategy for creating a surrogate key is to combine two existing columns into a new one.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_c varchar(256);

UPDATE table_name
SET column_c = CONCAT(column_a, column_b); 
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (column_c);
```

**Practice**
```sql
-- Add the new column to the table
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD COLUMN id serial;

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);

-- Have a look at the first 10 rows of professors
SELECT *
FROM professors
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- Count the number of distinct rows with columns make, model
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(make, model)) 
FROM cars;

-- Add the id column
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN id varchar(128);

-- Update id with make + model
UPDATE cars
SET id = CONCAT(make, model);

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD CONSTRAINT id_pk PRIMARY KEY(id);

-- Have a look at the table
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

```sql
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE students (
  last_name varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  ssn integer PRIMARY KEY,
  phone_no char(12)
);
```

# 4. Glue together tables with foreign keys

Leverage foreign keys to connect tables and establish relationships that will greatly benefit data quality. Run ad hoc analyses on new database.

## 4.1. Model 1:N relationships with foreign keys

**Implementing relationships with foreign keys**
* A foreign key (FK) points to the primary key (PK) of another table 
* Domain of FK must be equal to domain of PK
* Each value of FK must exist in PK of the other table (FK constraint or "referential integrity") 
* FKs are not actual keys

**Specifying foreign keys**

```sql
CREATE TABLE manufacturers (
name varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY);

INSERT INTO  manufacturers 
VALUES ('Ford'), ('VW'), ('GM'); 
CREATE TABLE cars (
model varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY,
manufacturer_name varchar(255) REFERENCES manufacturers (name));

INSERT INTO cars
VALUES ('Ranger', 'Ford'), ('Beetle', 'VW');

-- Throws an error! INSERT INTO cars
VALUES ('Tundra', 'Toyota');
```

**Specifying foreign keys to existing tables**
```sql
ALTER TABLE a
ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);
```
```sql
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
ALTER TABLE professors
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);
```

```sql
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'MIT');

insert or update on table "professors" violates foreign key constraint "professors_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (university_id)=(MIT) is not present in table "universities".

-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'UZH');
```

**JOIN tables linked by a foreign key**

```sql
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich
SELECT professors.lastname, universities.id, universities.university_city
FROM professors
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
WHERE universities.university_city = 'Zurich';
```

## 4.2. Model more complex relationships

**How to implement N:M-relationships**
* Create a table
* Add foreign keys for every connected table 
* Add additional attributes
```sql
CREATE TABLE affiliations (
professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id), organization_id varchar(256) REFERENCES organizations (id), function varchar(256)
);
```
* No primary key!
* Possible PK = {professor_id, organization_id, function}

```sql
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME organization TO organization_id;

-- Add a foreign key on organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id);
```

**Update columns of a table based on values in another table**
```sql
-- Update professor_id to professors.id where firstname, lastname correspond to rows in professors
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;

-- Have a look at the 10 first rows of affiliations again
SELECT *
FROM affiliations
LIMIT 10;
```

**Drop "firstname" and "lastname"**

The firstname and lastname columns of affiliations were used to establish a link to the professors table in the last exercise â€“ so the appropriate professor IDs could be copied over. This only worked because there is exactly one corresponding professor for each row in affiliations. In other words: {firstname, lastname} is a candidate key of professors â€“ a unique combination of columns.

It isn't one in affiliations though, because, as said in the video, professors can have more than one affiliation.

Because professors are referenced by professor_id now, the firstname and lastname columns are no longer needed, so it's time to drop them. After all, one of the goals of a database is to reduce redundancy where possible.

```sql
-- Drop the firstname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN firstname;

-- Drop the lastname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN lastname;
```

## 4.3. Referential integrity

**Referential integrity**
* A record referencing another table must refer to an existing record in that table: A record in table A cannot point to a record in table B that does not exist
* Specified between two tables 
* Enforced through foreign keys
So if you define a foreign key in the table "professors" referencing the table "universities", referential integrity is held from "professors" to "universities".

**Referential integrity violations**
Referential integrity from table A to table B is violated...
* ...if a record in table B that is referenced from a record in table A is deleted. Let's say table A references table B. So if a record in table B that is already referenced from table A is deleted, you have a violation
* ...if a record in table A referencing a non-existing record from table B is inserted: if you try to insert a record in table A that refers to something that does not exist in table B, you also violate the principle
* Foreign keys prevent violations!: they will throw errors and stop you from accidentally doing these things.

**Dealing with violations**
```sql
CREATE TABLE a (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY, column_a varchar(64),
    ...,
    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
);

CREATE TABLE a (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY, column_a varchar(64),
    ...,
    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**ON DELETE...**
* ...**NO ACTION**: Throw an error
* ...**CASCADE**: Delete all referencing records
* ...**RESTRICT**: Throw an error
* ...**SET NULL**: Set the referencing column to NULL
* ...**SET DEFAULT**: Set the referencing column to its default value

```sql
DELETE FROM universities WHERE id = 'EPF';

update or delete on table "universities" violates foreign key constraint "professors_fkey" on table "professors"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(EPF) is still referenced from table "professors".
```

It fails because referential integrity from professors to universities is violated

```sql

-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey;

-- Add a new foreign key constraint from affiliations to organizations which cascades deletion
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Delete an organization 
DELETE FROM organizations 
WHERE id = 'CUREM';

-- Check that no more affiliations with this organization exist
SELECT * FROM affiliations
WHERE organization_id = 'CUREM';
```

## 4.4. Ad-hoc SQL query

```sql
-- Filter the table and sort it
SELECT COUNT(*), organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
JOIN organizations
ON affiliations.organization_id = organizations.id
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
WHERE organizations.organization_sector = 'Media & communication'
GROUP BY organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
ORDER BY COUNT DESC;
```
