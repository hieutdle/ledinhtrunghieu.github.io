```py
import math
 math.sqrt(16)
4.0
```
This is an example of procedural abstraction. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.
Procedural abstraction as a process that hides the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view it at a very high level. We now turn our attention to a similar idea, that of data abstraction. An abstract data type, sometimes abbreviated ADT, is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented
By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the userâ€™s view. This is called information hiding.
The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a data structure, will require that we provide a physical view of the data using some collection of programming constructs and primitive data types.
