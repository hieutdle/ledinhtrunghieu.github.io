# 1. Introduction

It is also very common to include the word **computable** when describing problems and solutions. We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it.


```py
import math
 math.sqrt(16)
4.0
```


This is an example of **procedural abstraction**. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.

**Procedural abstraction** as a process that hides the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view it at a very high level. We now turn our attention to a similar idea, that of **data abstraction**. An **abstract data type**, sometimes abbreviated **ADT**, is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented


**Programming** is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer

All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have **data types**. Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved. These low-level, built-in data types (sometimes called the primitive data types) provide the building blocks for algorithm development.

Earlier, we referred to procedural abstraction as a process that hides the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view it at a very high level. We now turn our attention to a similar idea, that of **data abstraction**. An abstract data type, sometimes abbreviated ADT, is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented. This means that we are concerned only with what the data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed. By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the userâ€™s view. This is called information hiding.
