The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena and Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS are one of the most recommended ones. For quick reference, Cracking the Coding interview is a good one.

CLRS is so hard to understand .Well ,i never touched it after a week .

 Grokking Algorithms, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures, and Cracking the Coding Interview.
CTCI is not a data structures book. It is an interview preparation book. It only provides brief overviews of data structures and algorithms as its meant for people who already know them. I would go with one of the others.
