Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own
beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out
there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for
how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are.

How so? Well, our brain is always trying to make sense of our current situation based on what we
already believe and have already experienced. Every new piece of information is measured against
the values and conclusions we already have. As a result, our brain is always biased toward what we
feel to be true in that moment. So when we have a great relationship with our sister, we’ll interpret
most of our memories about her in a positive light. But when the relationship sours, we’ll often come
to see those exact same memories differently, reinventing them in such a way as to explain our
present-day anger toward her. That sweet gift she gave us last Christmas is now remembered as
patronizing and condescending. That time she forgot to invite us to her lake house is now seen not as
an innocent mistake but as horrible negligence.
