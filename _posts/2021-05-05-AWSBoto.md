# 1. Putting Files in the Cloud

Learning how AWS works to creating S3 buckets and uploading files to them. 

## 1.1. Intro to AWS and Boto3

**What is Boto3**

To interact with AWS in Python, we use the Boto3 library. 

```python
import 

s3 = boto3.client('s3',
                  region_name='us-east-1', 
                  aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID, 
                  aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

response = s3.list_buckets()


```

We initialize the client with an AWS service name, region, key and secret. The service name can be any of the 100+ available AWS services. The region is the geo region where our resources are located. **Key** and **secret** are like a username and password to an AWS account.

**Creating keys with IAM**

* Creating an account at aws.amazon.com gives us access to the AWS Console. Anything we do here to manage our web services, we can do in Boto3 in Python.
* To log into the console, we use the username/password we signed up with. This is the root user.
* To create the key/secret for Boto3, we are going to use IAM or Identity Access Management Service. We create IAM sub-users to control access to AWS resources in our account. Credentials - or the key / secret combo are what authenticate IAM users.
