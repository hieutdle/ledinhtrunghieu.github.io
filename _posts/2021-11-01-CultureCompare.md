**Universalism versus Particularism**

German: Universalism cultures believe that everything should be applied equally without any change or exception.
Vietnam: Particularism cultures believe that everything can be treated differently depending on situations. People of these cultures focus more on differences, relationships and circumstances.
they can bend the laws and orders for family members, close friends, or important people in special cases

**Individualism versus Communitarianism**
Germany: Individualism cultures are cultures in which people regard themselves as individuals. Personal freedom, growth and fulfillment are more valued than group achievement.

Vietnam: Communitarianism cultures are cultures in which people regard themselves as part of a group. The group always comes before the individual. People in this culture respect cooperation ltruism, public service and societal legacy. They believe that your quality of life is better when we help each other

**Neutral versus Emotional**
Neutral cultures are cultures in which emotions are hidden in public places. People in this culture see logic is more important than emotions when making decisions. 

Emotional cultures are cultures in which emotions are publicly and naturally expressed. In these cultures, people often show their emotions, make loud conservations when excited, and greet each other with excitement.

**Specific versus Diffuse**

Specific cultures believe that relationships and works are disjoint. Members of this culture keep work and personal life separately. 

Diffuse cultures see their personal and work life as interconnected. Strong and good
relationships at work are viewed as necessary to be successful at work. People believe that
achievements can be better achieved when relationships are strong. Therefore, colleagues
and clients communicate with each other outside of work more


**Achievement versus Ascription**
In an achievement culture, people receive status based on how well they perform their work.
Members of this type of culture believe that you are what you do or what you have done. They
value your performance, no matter who you are.

In an ascription culture, status is based on who or what a person is. Members of this type of
culture believe that one should be valued for their title and position. Power, authority, potential
and connections matter in these cultures. 


**Sequential versus Synchronic**
A sequential time culture is one in which the people like events to happen in order. The
punctuality is very important

In synchronic cultures the timeline can overlap. They often work on several projects at once,
and view distributions of time, plans and commitments as flexible. 

**Internal versus External control**

n inner-directed cultures, people believe that humans can control the outcomes by themselves
including their souls, wills, convictions, principles and core beliefs instead of the environment.
They can also change their environment as they want in order to achieve goals. 

In outer-directed cultures, people believe in letting things follow their own path and have a
more flexible attitude to compromise and maintain connection with nature. Members in this
culture believe that one’s environment controls them and affects their ability to achieve a goal.
They must be adaptive to their environment to achieve goals. At work or in a relationship,
maintaining a strong relationship is more important than winning. They focus their actions on
others and avoid conflict where possible to keep a good environment
